# HazelEngine

### Current View Completion Progress: `016` 

A step-by-step follow-along of The Cherno's C++ Game Engine series with functional incremental commits after most videos in case you get lost sometimes like me~.

For a log of changes/fixes that have resulted from the videos being slightly older ( but still useful as hell), you can check out the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/AllegroVivo/HazelEngine/blob/main/ChangeNotes.MD) maintained by by myself (and any contributors)!
